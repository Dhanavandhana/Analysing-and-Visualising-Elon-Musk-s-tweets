# Analysing-and-Visualising-Elon-Musk-s-tweets

The analysis done in this project are:

**1.Sentimental Analysis**
The imported libraries of sentimental analysis categorize the emotion 
(positive, negative, neutral) of each tweet based on the words present in it.
 The bar graph represents the number of positive, negative and neutral tweets.
 
 **2.Visualize the frequent words**
The most frequently used words in the tweets were displayed as a word cloud.

**3.Analyzing the Mentions**
 Initially the code is written to display all unique mentions made by Elon Musk.
Then the most frequently used top 10 mentions were plotted and displayed as a bar graph
(x-axis: Top 10 mention names, y-axis: Number of frequency)
A statistical analysis is done on the number of mentions made in a month and plotted in the form of graph
(x-axis: Months (Jan to Dec), y-axis: Number of mentions)
